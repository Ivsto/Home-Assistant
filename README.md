# IMPORTANT #
I have now created seperate repositories for versions 1 and 2 of my Garden Irrigation System.

Neither Version in *this* repository __will be updated__.

This repository should be considered as an archive. __It may be deleted at some point in the future.__

---

__Version 1__ is now at: https://github.com/kloggy/HA-Irrigation-Version1

That contains the very latest code including all changes I have made and is currently the version I use (until version 2 is fully implemented).


__Version 2__ is now at: https://github.com/kloggy/HA-Irrigation-Version2

In order to hopefully add some clarity there are some folder structure changes and some files have been renamed.

This might one day have my whole config but at the moment I have only posted a few sections which are (mostly) self contained packages.

1. My **Garden Irrigation** system,

2. My **Guest Mode** implemenation which allows for an ad-hoc setting along with two (or more) regular schedules
